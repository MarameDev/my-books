# My Books — Share & Track

This is a simple, minimalist pink-themed website to share and track books you’ve read.  
Users can submit book info via a form, and see a live-updating list with filtering options.

## How It Works

- Visitors can submit books using the form.  
- Each submission is sent directly to my email via FormSubmit.co.  
- New book entries don’t show up on the website automatically.  
- I manually update the book list on the site based on submissions I receive.  

This keeps the site simple and easy to maintain without needing complex backend or databases.
Feel free to submit your favorite books and check :)

## Features

- Submit books with title, author, rating, date read, and notes.
- Filter books by author and rating.
- Responsive and clean design with subtle animations.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Uses FormSubmit.co to handle form submissions via email.

## How to Use

1. Open the website: [https://maramedev.github.io/my-books/](https://maramedev.github.io/my-books/)
2. Add your books using the form.
3. Browse and filter the book list.

## Technology

- HTML5 & CSS3 for layout and styling.
- JavaScript for client-side filtering.
- Google Fonts for typography.
- FormSubmit.co for form backend without needing server code.
- Hosted with GitHub Pages.

## Notes

- Form submissions are sent via email to `bentabidou@gmail.com`.
- The site is static; book entries are not dynamically stored on the site but received by email.
- Future improvements could include user accounts and a database for storing book entries.

  I really tried my best but I need to learn backend stuff too :(
